GETTING THE PAGES TO SHOW UP
1) In proj/my_app create (if it doesn't exist) urls.py, add needed patterns
	ex 'url(r'^(?P<poll_id>\d+)/results/$', views.results, name='results'),'
	NB this configuration will capture the id and give it to you as poll_id arg
	to your view method
2) in proj/proj/urls.py, add a url for whatever you need
	ex 'url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),'
