WASHINGTON — Representative Vance McAllister, Republican of Louisiana, under heavy pressure from House Republican leaders since he was caught kissing a congressional aide, announced Monday that he would not seek re-election to the seat he has occupied for only five months.

But Representative Michael G. Grimm, a two-term Republican from New York, appeared to encounter no such pressure as he faced a 20-count indictment on Monday for fraud, tax evasion and employing illegal immigrants.

The disparate treatment of the two House members pointed up an odd dichotomy that has emerged since the current Republican leadership came to power pledging a get-tough response on ethics issues.

If House members are caught up in sexual peccadilloes or other made-for-television acts, they have been driven from Capitol Hill posthaste. If the allegations are more complicated, they have largely been given a pass.

“Financial improprieties do in fact reflect just as badly,” said former Representative Mark Foley, who was driven from Congress in 2006 after salacious Internet conversations emerged between him and former male House pages. “The House has to decide what are the standards and how should they be applied. It’s not just if you get caught up in a sex scandal. Shouldn’t all infractions involve the same penalty box?”

Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the majority leader, did not comment on Monday as Mr. Grimm appeared in court to face federal fraud charges that he concealed more than $1 million in earnings from his Manhattan restaurant by underreporting wages and employing illegal immigrants. He was charged with perjury, wire fraud, mail fraud, obstruction of justice, obstructing and impeding tax laws, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

“I know I’m a moral man, a man of integrity,” Mr. Grimm said after his arraignment.

Mr. Grimm did resign his post on the House Financial Services Committee on Monday evening, an action the speaker deemed “appropriate under the circumstances,” said a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel.

Republicans noted that Mr. Grimm, unlike Mr. McAllister, was proclaiming his innocence. The indictment had nothing to do with his time in Congress, although he remains under investigation for allegations of campaign finance improprieties.

Critics drew different distinctions.

“They want to get rid of the members whose scandals are easily covered by the 24-hour news channels round the clock,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Complicated financial dealings aren’t.”

Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had a different explanation: Mr. McAllister hails from a staunchly Republican district, as did Trey Radel, who resigned from the House early this year after being arrested with cocaine. Mr. Grimm is one of the biggest Democratic targets this campaign year, and it is too late to replace his name on the ballot in November.

“They seem to hasten the departure of members in districts they consider safe, but in competitive districts, they put their political interests ahead of their zero-tolerance policy and the people of their districts,” he said.

Mr. Boehner took charge of the House Republican Conference in 2006, after a rash of ethics cases helped Democrats sweep to power in Congress. The House majority leader, Tom DeLay of Texas, was under indictment. Representative Bob Ney of Ohio had pleaded guilty to charges arriving from the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. Federal agents swept into the homes of Representatives John Doolittle of California and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. Just weeks before Election Day that year, Mr. Foley’s scandal directly swept top Republican leaders into allegations of a cover-up.

Since then, consequences of some kinds of ethical slips have been swift and final. Mr. McAllister faced pressure from his leadership since early this month, when a security camera caught the conservative politician who ran as a Christian family man kissing an aide in his district office.

“I expect all members to be held to the highest ethical standards, and this is no different,” Mr. Boehner told reporters before leaving for a spring recess. “He’s got decisions that he has to make.”

Mr. Radel tried to hold on after his arrest in October. He resigned in January.

In 2010, just days after Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana, confessed to an affair with a married staff member, he stepped down. Representative Chris Lee, Republican of New York, lasted only hours in 2011 after he was caught looking for sex on Craigslist, posting a photo with his shirt off.

Democratic leaders have been more lax. Representative Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of New York, took nearly a month to step down in 2011 after a scandal over his online behavior broke. Democratic leaders were particularly slow in demanding any kind of action after investigators moved in on Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, then-chairman of the House’s powerful tax-writing committee, for failing to pay all his taxes.

But, Ms. Sloan said, ethics issues over all seemed to be on an upswing. A series of cases have been referred recently to the House Ethics Committee, involving Republicans like Representatives Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Steve Stockman of Texas, and Luis V. Gutiérrez and Bobby L. Rush, Democrats of Illinois.

“They really cleaned up their act in the wake of Abramoff investigation. Now people seem to be feeling more relaxed,” Ms. Sloan said.
