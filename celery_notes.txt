INSTALLATION
1) Type 'pip' to make sure you have pip installed (should already be)
	a. if it's not go to http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html
2) 'pip install celery' to install celery
3) Install RabbitMQ
	a. 'brew install rabbitmq'
	b. edit your .profile ('open -a TextEdit ~/.profile') and add
		export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
		to the end of it
	c. then 'source ~/.profile'

FIRE UP ZE ENGINES
1) 'rabbitmq-server' to start the RabbitMQ server
2) In another shell, once you have your tasks.py and config stuff setup, 'celery -A my_project_name worker -l info'
	For our purposes, my_project_name = newsfeed_site
3) start the django server in yet another shell and you're good to go.
